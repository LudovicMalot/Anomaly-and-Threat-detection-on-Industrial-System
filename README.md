# üîç Industrial Anomaly Detection using LSTM & Reinforcement Learning (SWaT Dataset)

This project demonstrates a **hybrid approach** to anomaly detection in industrial control systems, combining **deep learning** (LSTM + attention) and **reinforcement learning** (DQN). The dataset used is the **Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)** dataset, a popular benchmark for cyber-physical anomaly detection.

## üß† What This Project Does

It detects anomalies in real-time sensor data using a **two-stage pipeline**:

1. **Hybrid Deep Learning Model**: An LSTM-based network with feature-wise attention first analyzes multivariate time series data to detect potential anomalies.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: The outputs of the LSTM model are then passed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN), which acts as a human-in-the-loop anomaly detector with tailored reward policies, refining the final decision.

This chaining (LSTM ‚Üí RL) leverages the strengths of both deep learning for temporal feature extraction and reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making.
